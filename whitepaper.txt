4. Features

 4.1 User Registration & Profile Management
- Web3 Integration : Users can log in using Web3 wallets (e.g.Phantom) without requiring traditional login methods.
- Profile Creation: Users can create profiles containing their basic information, previous work, and links to external portfolios (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn).
- Skill Display: Show verified skills, certificates, endorsements, and ratings on user profiles.

4.2 **Skill Validation**
   Challenges and Quests**: Provide coding challenges and technical tasks for users to complete. Successful completion results in skill validation.
-  Project-based Validation**: Users can submit completed projects (e.g., from GitHub) for evaluation and skill certification.
- Endorsements**: Other users or validators can endorse specific skills, adding credibility.
- Smart Contracts for Validation**: Use blockchain-based smart contracts to manage the validation process. Once the challenge is verified, the user’s skill is recorded on the blockchain.

4.3 Decentralized Skill Ledger
- Blockchain Integration : Skill validations are recorded on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and accessible by anyone for verification.
- NFT-based Skill Badges : Issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as proof of validated skills. These badges are unique, verifiable, and stored in the user’s Web3 wallet.
- Publicly Verifiable: Anyone (employers, clients, etc.) can verify the skills without needing centralized approval.

#### 4.4 **Employer and Recruiter Dashboard**
- **Search for Talent**: Employers can search for specific skills and find developers with verified credentials.
- **Verification Reports**: Employers can generate reports of candidates' verified skills directly from the blockchain.
- **Job Postings**: Employers can create job listings that require specific skill validations as prerequisites.

#### 4.5 **Skill Marketplace**
- **Endorsement Marketplace**: Users can pay for premium endorsements from top professionals, verified institutions, or certified trainers.
- **Skill Verification as a Service**: Educational institutions and certifying bodies can offer paid skill verification services.

#### 4.6 **Integration with External Platforms**
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatically verify contributions to open-source projects.
- **LinkedIn Integration**: Sync verified skills with LinkedIn profiles.
- **Online Learning Platforms**: Integrate with platforms like Udemy or Coursera to validate completed courses and certifications.

#### 4.7 **Rewards and Incentives**
- **Token System**: Introduce a native token as a reward mechanism for completing challenges, endorsing other users, or validating skills.
- **Community Voting**: The community can vote on the difficulty or relevance of skill challenges using the native token.
- **Skill Leveling**: Users can “level up” specific skills based on completed challenges and endorsements.

#### 4.8 **Security & Privacy**
- **Immutable Records**: All skill validations are immutable and stored on the blockchain.
- **Data Privacy**: User profiles and data will only be shared with permission, and sensitive information will remain private unless users choose to disclose it.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Leverage decentralized storage solutions (e.g., IPFS) to store project submissions or other important documents.
